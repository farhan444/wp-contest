= FEATURES =

**Convert visitors into adding items to cart:**

- Pop up recent order notifications on site corner to create the sense of a busy store (both sync real orders and create “fake” orders)
- Add sales countdown clock, low-stock indicator on product pages to create urgency and scarcity
- Show how many people have viewed and bought products to build social proof
- Show a coupon popup to encourage new visitors to make first purchase (can collect email subscribers or social likes)
- On mobile web version: add a Buy Now button fixed on top or bottom when customers browse
- On mobile web version: enhance product images with full-screen view as a native gallery

**Increase average order value:**

- Upsell & Cross-sell related products (support both manual product selection and auto-recommendation)
- Bundle up frequently bought together products and sell the combo at a value discount
- Show Best Sellers, Recently Viewed, Who Bought This Also Bought, Recommendations Based on Cart product carousel sliders
- Sales Gamification: Motivate customers to spend more to reach a cart value threshold and receive a reward discount
- Suggest more related products at cart page, right before checkout

**Increase checkout rate & prevent cart abandonment:**

- Offer a cart-level discount, free-shipping, or free gift, if customers complete order
- Use countdown timer to limit offer: customers must check out before time runs out to get the reward
- Show offer at exit-intent to prevent customers from leaving and continue checkout

**Recover abandoned carts & promote repeat purchases:**

- Upsell more products after checkout to invite repeat purchases (offer coupons to incentivise)
- Send cart & browse abandonment emails
- Send cross-sell emails, new arrivals emails, win-back emails to retain customers

**Build long-term customer relationship & retain loyal customers:**

- Chat with customers via Facebook Messenger right on store (not navigating customers out of store)
- Send a welcome email to new customers from store’s founder or staff email address
- Follow up customers with personalized emails, triggered when customers enter a segment (work as Mailchimp but more optimized for eCommerce)
